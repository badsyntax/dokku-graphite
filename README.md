## usage

```shell
# create a graphite service named lolipop
dokku graphite:create lolipop

# you can also specify the image and image
# version to use for the service
# it *must* be compatible with the
# dokkupaas/docker-grafana-graphite image
export GRAPHITE_IMAGE="dokkupaas/docker-grafana-graphite"
export GRAPHITE_IMAGE_VERSION="3.0.1"
dokku graphite:create lolipop

# you can also specify custom environment
# variables to start the graphite service
# in semi-colon separated form
export GRAPHITE_CUSTOM_ENV="USER=alpha;HOST=beta"
dokku graphite:create lolipop

# get connection information as follows
dokku graphite:info lolipop

# you can also retrieve a specific piece of service info via flags
dokku graphite:info lolipop --config-dir
dokku graphite:info lolipop --data-dir
dokku graphite:info lolipop --dsn
dokku graphite:info lolipop --exposed-ports
dokku graphite:info lolipop --id
dokku graphite:info lolipop --internal-ip
dokku graphite:info lolipop --links
dokku graphite:info lolipop --service-root
dokku graphite:info lolipop --status
dokku graphite:info lolipop --version

# a bash prompt can be opened against a running service
# filesystem changes will not be saved to disk
dokku graphite:enter lolipop

# you may also run a command directly against the service
# filesystem changes will not be saved to disk
dokku graphite:enter lolipop ls -lah /

# a graphite service can be linked to a
# container this will use native docker
# links via the docker-options plugin
# here we link it to our 'playground' app
# NOTE: this will restart your app
dokku graphite:link lolipop playground

# the following environment variables will be set automatically by docker (not
# on the app itself, so they wonâ€™t be listed when calling dokku config)
#
#   DOKKU_GRAPHITE_LOLIPOP_NAME=/random_name/GRAPHITE
#   DOKKU_GRAPHITE_LOLIPOP_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.1:8125
#   DOKKU_GRAPHITE_LOLIPOP_PORT_8125_UDP=udp://172.17.0.1:8125
#   DOKKU_GRAPHITE_LOLIPOP_PORT_8125_UDP_PROTO=tcp
#   DOKKU_GRAPHITE_LOLIPOP_PORT_8125_UDP_PORT=8125
#   DOKKU_GRAPHITE_LOLIPOP_PORT_8125_UDP_ADDR=172.17.0.1
#
# and the following will be set on the linked application by default
#
#   STATSD_URL=statsd://dokku-graphite-lolipop:8125
#
# NOTE: the host exposed here only works internally in docker containers. If
# you want your container to be reachable from outside, you should use `expose`.

# another service can be linked to your app
dokku graphite:link other_service playground

# since STATSD_URL is already in use, another environment variable will be
# generated automatically
#
#   DOKKU_STATSD_BLUE_URL=statsd://dokku-graphite-other_service:8125

# you can then promote the new service to be the primary one
# NOTE: this will restart your app
dokku graphite:promote other_service playground

# this will replace STATSD_URL with the url from other_service and generate
# another environment variable to hold the previous value if necessary.
# you could end up with the following for example:
#
#   STATSD_URL=statsd://dokku-graphite-other_service:8125
#   DOKKU_STATSD_BLUE_URL=statsd://dokku-graphite-other_service:8125
#   DOKKU_STATSD_SILVER_URL=statsd://dokku-graphite-lolipop:8125

# you can also unlink a graphite service
# NOTE: this will restart your app and unset related environment variables
dokku graphite:unlink lolipop playground

# you can tail logs for a particular service
dokku graphite:logs lolipop
dokku graphite:logs lolipop -t # to tail

# finally, you can destroy the container
dokku graphite:destroy lolipop
```

## Changing database adapter

It's possible to change the protocol for STATSD_URL by setting
the environment variable STATSD_DATABASE_SCHEME on the app:

```
dokku config:set playground STATSD_DATABASE_SCHEME=statsd2
dokku graphite:link lolipop playground
```

Will cause STATSD_URL to be set as
statsd2://dokku-graphite-lolipop:8125

CAUTION: Changing STATSD_DATABASE_SCHEME after linking will cause dokku to
believe the graphite is not linked when attempting to use `dokku graphite:unlink`
or `dokku graphite:promote`.
You should be able to fix this by

- Changing STATSD_URL manually to the new value.

OR

- Set STATSD_DATABASE_SCHEME back to its original setting
- Unlink the service
- Change STATSD_DATABASE_SCHEME to the desired setting
- Relink the service

## Disabling `docker pull` calls

If you wish to disable the `docker pull` calls that the plugin triggers, you may set the `GRAPHITE_DISABLE_PULL` environment variable to `true`. Once disabled, you will need to pull the service image you wish to deploy as shown in the `stderr` output.

Please ensure the proper images are in place when `docker pull` is disabled.
